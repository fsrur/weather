Weather information application built with React. It provides a 4-day weather forecast based on the user's ZIP code in the United States. Users can input their ZIP code, and the application will leverage the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display comprehensive weather information including daily high and low temperatures, along with relevant weather icons.
